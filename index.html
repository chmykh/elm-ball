<h1>Hello Elm</h1>
<br>This is a helloworld program written in the Elm programming language.
<br>The bouncing ball simulation is among my favoutire <i>helloworld</i>-kind programs, I've implemented dozens of it in different programming languages. If a user does not interfere, the ball should bounce forever at the same height. User can move the ground line up and down by click-and-drag anywhere at the whitespace. This way a user can either catch the ball tenderly, preventing a bounce, or push it high into air, out of screen.
<br>In the bottom line, K stands for kinetic energy, P for gravitational potential, D for potential energy of deformation. The full energy E=K+P+D should remain constant for reasonably fine simulation (i.e. moderate ball velocity).
